# Assignment 3: Tensor Operations Practice

## Overview
This repository explores foundational tensor operations using both **TensorFlow 2.x** and **PyTorch**, with an emphasis on mastering tensor manipulation, broadcasting, reshaping, matrix multiplication, and advanced operations such as `einsum`. This assignment serves as a practical deep dive into one of the most critical building blocks in deep learningâ€”**tensors**.

The work is divided into two main notebooks:
- TensorFlow operations, including `einsum` demonstrations.
- PyTorch operations, showcasing core tensor manipulations.

## 1. Tensor Operations in TensorFlow

### Description
A Colab notebook focused on implementing and visualizing various tensor operations using **TensorFlow 2.0**, including broadcasting, reshaping, dot product, matrix multiplication, and **Einstein summation** (`einsum`).

### Features
- Basic tensor creation and manipulation
- Shape and dimensionality exploration
- Broadcasting rules in depth
- Matrix operations (`matmul`, `tensordot`, etc.)
- Advanced `einsum` demonstrations with visual explanations

## 2. Tensor Operations in PyTorch

### Description
This notebook mirrors the TensorFlow implementation but uses **PyTorch**, offering comparisons and PyTorch-native syntax to understand how both libraries handle tensors.

### Features
- Tensor initialization, slicing, and reshaping
- PyTorch broadcasting and arithmetic
- Linear algebra operations
- Using `.einsum()` and `torch.einsum` for complex operations
- Tensor visualization and debugging tips
