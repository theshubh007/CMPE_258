        "\n",
        "In this notebook, I fine-tuned a language model using **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** via the **Unsloth** and **TRL** libraries. The goal was to train a reward model using pairs of preferred and rejected responses, allowing the model to learn to generate more desirable outputs based on user preference alignment. The key steps include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Installing necessary libraries like `unsloth`, `trl`, and `datasets`.\n",
        "- Loading a preference dataset (with chosen vs. rejected examples).\n",
        "- Formatting the dataset into instruction-preference pairs.\n",
        "- Preparing and loading the model using Unsloth with quantized optimization.\n",
        "- Configuring and training using `DPOTrainer`.\n",
        "- Saving the fine-tuned preference-aligned model for future use or deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is particularly useful for aligning models with human-like behavior without requiring reinforcement learning.\n"
