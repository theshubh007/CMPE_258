# Multi-Modal Language Models: PaLI-GEMMA 2 for JSON Data Extraction

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the power of multi-modal AI through a practical implementation of PaLI-GEMMA 2, Google's advanced vision-language model. The notebook explores how this model can be fine-tuned to extract structured JSON data from images, enabling powerful applications in document understanding, visual data extraction, and automated data processing.

## Key Objectives

- Implement and demonstrate PaLI-GEMMA 2 for structured data extraction from images
- Showcase the fine-tuning process using parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA)
- Provide clear, reproducible code with detailed explanations
- Analyze model performance with real examples and visualizations

## Technical Highlights

- **Cross-Modal Processing**: Implementation of a model that seamlessly handles both images and text
- **Structured JSON Extraction**: Converting visual information into structured, machine-readable formats
- **Fine-Tuning Techniques**: Parameter-efficient adaptation of pre-trained models for specialized tasks
- **Deployment Options**: Exploration of ways to deploy the fine-tuned model in various environments
