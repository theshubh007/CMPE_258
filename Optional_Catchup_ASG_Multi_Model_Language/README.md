# Optional Catchup Assignment: Multi-Modal Language Model Use Exercise

## üåê Overview

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook demonstrating various use cases of multi-modal language models. The notebook explores how these advanced models can process and generate content across different modalities including text, images, and structured data, showcasing their capabilities in understanding and generating cross-modal content.

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate practical implementations of multi-modal language models by:

- Exploring how models process different types of input modalities (text, images)
- Demonstrating cross-modal reasoning and generation capabilities
- Implementing and fine-tuning multi-modal models for specific tasks
- Providing detailed code explanations and output analysis
